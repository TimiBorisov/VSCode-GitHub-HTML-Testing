# Here's a summary of the steps I took:

I have already completed the process of creating a simple HTML file and pushing it to a GitHub repository.

#Creation of HTML File: I used Visual Studio Code to create a new file named index.html. Then, I copied and pasted the HTML code into this file.

#Saving the File: After creating index.html, I saved it in a directory on my local machine where I manage my web development projects.

#Initialization of Git: I initialized a Git repository in my project directory by running the command git init in my terminal.

#Adding the HTML File: I added the index.html file to the staging area of the Git repository using the command git add index.html.

#Committing Changes: With the command git commit -m "Add initial version of index.html", I committed the added HTML file to the repository with a meaningful commit message.

#Creation of GitHub Repository: Moving to GitHub, I created a new repository by clicking on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and selecting "New repository". I followed the instructions to set up the repository with an appropriate name and settings.

#Setting Remote Origin: I linked my local Git repository to the GitHub repository by copying the URL of my GitHub repository and running the command git remote add origin <repository_url> in my terminal.

#Pushing to GitHub: Using the command git push -u origin master, I pushed my committed changes to the GitHub repository. If my main branch had a different name than 'master', I would have replaced it accordingly.

#Verification on GitHub: Finally, I verified on GitHub by visiting my repository in a web browser to ensure that the index.html file had been successfully pushed and was visible in the repository.

By following these steps, I successfully created an HTML file, initialized a Git repository, linked it to a GitHub repository, and pushed my changes to GitHub. Now, my HTML code is hosted on GitHub and accessible to anyone with the repository URL.
